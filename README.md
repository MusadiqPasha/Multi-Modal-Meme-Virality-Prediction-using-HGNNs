# Multi-Modal-Meme-Virality-Prediction-using-HGNNs

This repository showcases a mini-project developed for **DLG UE22AM342BA2: Deep Learning on Graphs**. It presents a multimodal meme virality predictor that integrates image, text, and metadata through ensemble learning and Hypergraph Neural Networks to classify memes as viral or non-viral.

## Dataset

We use a Reddit-based meme dataset with over 5,600 memes. It includes:
- Images from various meme subreddits
- Extracted text from images using OCR
- Metadata: timestamps, subreddit name, post score

**Download**: [Kaggle - Meme Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/musadiqpashak/meme-dataset)

## Problem Statement

Virality on social media is influenced by diverse factors: visual cues, textual content, timing, and platform dynamics. This project predicts whether a meme will go viral or not using multimodal inputs and innovative learning techniques.

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Multimodal Ensemble Model

#### Overview
This approach independently processes each data modality (image, text, and metadata) through specialized models and then combines their outputs using late fusion (ensemble averaging).

#### Components

1. **Textual Pipeline (OCR + BERT)**
   - OCR: Used PyTesseract to extract text from meme images.
   - Embedding: Tokenized and embedded extracted text using pre-trained BERT.
   - Classification: Feed-forward neural network trained on BERT embeddings.
   - Explainability: Attention visualization and SHAP were used to interpret token-level importance.

2. **Visual Pipeline (CLIP-based Embeddings)**
   - Model: Used OpenAI’s CLIP to embed meme images into a 512-dimensional latent space.
   - Classifier: Small MLP trained on these embeddings.

3. **Tabular Metadata Pipeline**
   - Features used: Time of post, Subreddit, Score, Post hour
   - Processing: One-hot encoding, binning, and SHAP analysis.

4. **Ensemble Fusion**
   - Combined predictions from all three classifiers using weighted averaging.

#### Results
- Accuracy: ~69%
- Highlights: Best performance with balanced precision and recall.

### Approach 2: Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)

#### Overview
Constructs a hypergraph where each node represents a meme and hyperedges represent shared metadata features (e.g., time bins, subreddit clusters). Node features are created by concatenating CLIP and BERT embeddings.

#### Methodology

1. **Feature Fusion**
   - Node vector = [CLIP (512-d) || BERT (768-d)] = 1,280-d vector

2. **Hyperedge Construction**
   - Based on similar:
     - Subreddits
     - Time bins
     - Score clusters

3. **Learning**
   - Used a Hypergraph Convolution Layer (HyperConv)
   - Final softmax layer for classification

#### Results
- Accuracy: ~66–67%
- Highlights: Better recall on viral memes and good generalization through group-level structure
